IndoorWayfindingfortheVisuallyImpaired
======================================
In this topic we designed an app that helps the visually impaired navigate an indoor environment.
Through the iBeacons you can discover the general location of the visually impaired person and provide 
a wayfinding solution for them to get to different rooms in the environment.

The user will enter the chosen destination and the application will talk back the navigation instructions.

Then we designed a “Vision Free” user interface for the user.

The major work is in server and mainActivity.
